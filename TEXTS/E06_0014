Message from James 

Commander this is urgent!! 
We gethered enough evidence that arachnoids to support 
our theory that arachnoids has been abducting people 
in this region!
Evidence suggests that their central lair is somewhere 
to the north. They have abducted inhabitants from our last
searched town very recently. Those people might still be 
alive and we shoud try to rescue them!
It's time to attackt that arrachnoid teritory!!
