Message from the Sniper Team

Commander, we are very greatful for your help.

On the other hand we have some disturbing news.
Our reconnaissance of the enemy teritory revealed,
that powerful mages have their sacrificial temple further
to the north. They sacrifice humans in the name of 
their gods and in return they appearently are 
rewarded with magical energy. Moreover they have 
multiple transportation devices there. 
That's how they were able to get so many reinforcement.
