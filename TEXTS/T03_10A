This is heavily marshy terain! It will be difficult 
fight. However, some soldiers are trapped in the 
area, we should attempt to find them!
But beware! There is something strange going on here.
Our reconnaissance says there are no enemy unit's 
on this territory. And no magic is detected from here
either!
