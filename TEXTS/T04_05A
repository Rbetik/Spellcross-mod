Commander, this is highly urgent!! Some of our science expedition 
was caught offguard in the middle of exploring strange magic source
in the area. They are surrounded by undead creatures, most of their 
security is gone, only some TAM tanks are still defending them. 
They will not last long If we don't help them!!. 
(You should do this mission with at least one free unit slot)
