We found civilians! There is a lot of them, they look scared 
and tired. It must have been weeks since OS took over surrounding
areas. 
They have some hand guns and homemade weapons.

But wait a minute what's that??!! One of the man has dynamite strapped 
to his chest and holds detonator!!

Hes yelling that he will kill as many of other-side units as possilbe 
for what they have done to his family!

He begs us to help him kill whatever otherside units we can find.

As hursh as it sounds this is the time of war, and desperate times 
calls for desperate measures.
Our troops just spotted some orsk lurking behind the house, 
lets help him avenge his family!!!
