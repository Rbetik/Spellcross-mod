Oh My Good!
We see it, it's realy there, disguasting slime.
It realy seems like hude blob with no limbs or head.
After a few minutes of observation we saw that 
one blob split into two rapidly. New blobs seem
to behave exactly like original one. And they grow
in size realy quickly as they soak the water from the
swamp.
We better not engage in the fight, let's regroup 
and thing of some strategy.
