For further advancment of our forces we shoudl conquer this 
territory containing important road towards Theyssen mountains.
The road is surrounded by hilly terrain controlled by enemy forces.
We susspect heavy enemy pressence, and our scouts detected deadly
arrowthrowers in the area. Best advice would be to either ignore 
this territory and try to reach main enemy camp other way or wait 
until we have a strong army.
