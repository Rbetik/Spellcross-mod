Jeezes, this is disgusting. 
Pieces of partially digested orks along with our soldiers!!

It looks like in the slaughterhouse everything is covered 
with some slime. Slime, which seems to slowly dissolve 
biological substances. 

Our soulders have a chills running throught their bodies.
It feels like something is lurking in the swamp!!
