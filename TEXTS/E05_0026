Message from science team:
Commander, this is fascinating!!! We have their 
magical well, can you believe it!. The initial 
studies shown that the high concentration of 
magic forces carbon to form unnatural fullerides.
This gives rise to multiple categories of unusual 
materials ranging from archotic crystals to 
superconductors. We definitelly have to research 
this phenomenon in more detail!! The potential 
for new weaponery is almost limitless.
