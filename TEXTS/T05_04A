Sniper team equipped with laser targeting system 
was suppose to paint the targets in surrounding area for 
the airstrikes. Unfortunatelly, the highground position,
where they were suppose to camp is occupied by 
otherside units. Our mission is to help the 
TP-team to get to the highground.
There is no rush, the team is well hidden near the 
target position and will wait for us.
We shouldn't engage before the other side invasion 
is over.
