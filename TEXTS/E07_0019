Message from the head of the scientists!

I knew it! I knew there was something wrong with how quiet it looked! 
This ambush that was waiting for you was well prepared and organized 
and most importantely well hidden!

We can only presume that enemy will try to something similar on the 
gate teritory as well.  And I presume they will not make the same mistake 
of sanding the army to chase us again.

I suggest we harras this land by conquering the territirries important 
for the enemy, as long as necessary to provoke dragoth to sand the army 
to stop us.
