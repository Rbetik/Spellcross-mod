Message from James:

This is unbelievable!
Just to clerify it: Orks shamans perform some 
rituals in the temples like the one you just 
conquered. And in some way they get magic 
enegry from it? And they use that energy 
"somehow" in their weapons and armors??
The fuck is this??

Moreover. That leader of theirs, that ork
general or whatever... how is he able to give 
orders on long distances and in that accursed 
mist? Telepathy?? could it realy work?

The artefact we found after he fled is 
fascinating. We dont know how it works or 
even what it does. You shoud definitelly invest
in research of it!
