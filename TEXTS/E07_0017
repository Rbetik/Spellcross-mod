Commander, the northern teritory is where wher general Tarag-gur has 
his pallace. The gate is right behind it! Reconnaissance says 
it is weakly protected and we should not have much of the problem
conquering it.

However, our accurate measurements of magic concentration in the 
area are wery strange to say the least. I don't want to 
get technical, simply put they are too weak for the
presence of so many mages and dragoth himself. I feel there's 
something funky going on!
