We are at the foot of Theyssen mountains, The time has come 
for our attack! It seems that here lies the main enamy camp.
If we succed with conquering this staging area the enemy forces 
in hole region will be forced to retreat and let us take controll.
We're facing the enemy who doesnt yet know the taste of defeat,
and on the other hand our alliance forces didn't yet had a 
strategic victory of this type. Let's teach the the horde of 
chaos how defeat tasets!!
