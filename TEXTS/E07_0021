Message from James:

John this is realy urgent, my guys found something 
realy important in ruins of Tharag-gur's castle!

Ork generals arent usually high ranking officers of
enemys army. This is not only due to how society of
enemy works but also because their psionic ability arent
sufficient to thelepatically control larger forces.

We were wondering long time why Tharag-gur is a general.
In his castle we found large spheric glowing orb.
After brief examination, our psionic experts suspect that 
orb artificially magnifies thelepatic communication.

If we could use it against our enemy it would be great.
I advice to immediatelly start with the research!!
