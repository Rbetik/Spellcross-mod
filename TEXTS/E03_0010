Message from the science team

Hello Cpt. Alexander I'm heppy to inform you that 
our new base in this hilly terrain has been estabili-
shed.                                               

There are rummors about some new creatures that looks
like deat skeletons. Those enemies would certainly 
be in the interest of scientists if you manage to kill
some.                                                 

Have a good day 
Huntik (almost) Ph.D.
