The mission is a succes, we saved many people. 
They are realy scared and hungry. They were in hiding 
for last 3 weeks since other side captured surrounding 
land. They are quite lucky that they are alive.

Unfortunatelly we didnt prevent that poor man's suicide.
It's probably much worse than we anticipaded. What kind 
of horrible things must have those people witness to 
drive them to such a desperate measure just to kill a few orks?
