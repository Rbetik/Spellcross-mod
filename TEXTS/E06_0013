Hello commander, this region use to be rich industrial area
before the war. There were metal ore mines in the center 
and a powerpland to the west. In addition we discovered that enemy
has one of their magical wells here!!! If we could conquer all 
those regions and reestabilish the industry it would significantelly 
increase our resource potencial!
