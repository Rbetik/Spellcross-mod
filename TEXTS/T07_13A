We have to destroy those teleportation devices so that 
enemy doesn't get any more reinforcments. This territory 
is controlled by general Tharag-gur, first commander 
of Dragoth, his death should be our priority.
The ambush army is not here anymore, they tried to chase us and
left this position. But general is surrounded by fearsome 
army and is determinated to fight to the death!
