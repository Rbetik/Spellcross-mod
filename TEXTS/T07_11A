The circle of conjurers has their 'nest' in this 
teritory. They are fanatically devoted to general 
Tarag-gur and they will not give their sacred 
ground without the fight. Prepare for tough 
fight! The kamikadze birds are one of the most
scary enemy units.
This however, should be one of the territories we 
should poke if we wont to provoke a fight!
