Hi Alexander, 
I need to tolk to you about that hilly territory.
Recoinessance confirmed that there caves on top 
of the hill. 
So far we know very little about their lifecycle.

You have a choice to try to destroy the enterance
to the caves, and therefore reduce the enemy 
pressance on the territory, which would definitelly 
make your consecutive fight much easier.
However if you would conquer the territory without
destroying the caves who knows what we could find 
inside.

Decision is yours of course. (I would personally
like to study haprys, however I understand that 
putting lives of your soldier at risk for that 
may not be worth it)

PS. 
for the choice of destroying the caves do the 
time mission.
If you let the time run out, or fail the cave 
destroying mission the fihgt will be tough 
but we will be able to study harpys nests.
