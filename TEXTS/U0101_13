Oh great i can see the barn, it seems quiet.

Hang on...
hey I can hear some distress signal on my walkie-tolkie...

There's a lot of static, but I can hear something about 
secret science unit ambushed .... or something like that.

It's comming from the east-north, I should go and check it out.
Maybe I can help them.
