Hello commander.

As you probably already know due to the fact that you helped me
escape from that hellhole week ago, I managed to convice 
the alliance high command that you would be the best choice
for our new scientific plan of 
... wait for it...

FREASR

field research and enemy artifact retrieval and study

... i know .. high command is not the best with naming things.

Anyway what it means is that I an my team will be deployded
with you and your units wherever you persue your military goals.
I will inform you about important scientific things as we progress.
But of course I'll provide guidelines, you can go whatever you see
fit, since you're in charge here.

With best regards James Robertson Ph.D.
