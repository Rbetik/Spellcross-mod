Message from James:

Commander this is absolutely fascinating.
It looks like some kind of spring of magical 
energy. The most fascinating thing is that
carbon that gets near this source is forced 
to form fullerenes of unusual forms never seen 
before!!. Morover, it seems that those fullerenes
can accumulate magical energy and release it 
subsequently as a heat if initiated properly.

Dead tissue contains a lot of carbon, could this
explain why the dead reises from the graves near
the magic sources???
