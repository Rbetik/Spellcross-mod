Message from the science team:


Hello, I regret to inform you, commander, that from 
other regions we heard news about enemies much stonger
than what we face here, they emerged suddenly and they 
will probably cross our paths in the near future.

Our colleagues try as hard as they can to understand them
and find the way to fight them, however any halp in 
research that we could do we should. 

From what I heard I can strongly advice you to research 
as much as you can afford and save as much money as you 
can spare you will probably need that resources later.

There are several ways to make money. Natural resouces 
on conquered territories are one of them, pretty 
straightforward, however occasionally we can find enemy 
artefacts that we have no use for, my firend in 
central research center will pay us a good money for 
them. All you have to do is clear the territory, I'll 
get you your funds :-).

James
