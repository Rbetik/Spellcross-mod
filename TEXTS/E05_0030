Message from science team:

Commander the materials we discovered near the 
magic wells are just remarkable! Some are even 
superconducting at room temperature!! Chemically 
they are almost pure carbon in the form of 
fullerenes of nanotubes. Extremaly light and 
highly durable.... 
Just imagine the technology we will be able to 
invent using these!!

At the same time, commander let me remind you;
it may seem at the moment that you have enough 
resources at hand, but nevertheless choose what 
you spend your credit for wisely, the upgrades 
from new materials will be extremly expensive!!

James
