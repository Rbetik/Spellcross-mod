Hello commander.
It's good that you decided to keep me around.
We're becoming a good team.
My friend in hi-command informed me that 
your name cought some attention!! Great job.

I'll get to the building of provisory field 
research center ASAP.

I have some good news, my guys managed to build
device we call 'magic pressence detector' MPD for 
short. Do you remember that ork camp we raided 
as a key territory on your last assigment? We
found some small artifacts there. We found out
that they react to the magic, and by carefull 
measurement of their internal heat we can 
determine level of 'magic' in the air with it!
Provisory ... yes, but it can be usefull.

For now we only detect small magic pressence.

James
