The soldiers!! at last!! At least some of the soldiers 
are still alive!
They are in bad shape, most of them are sick and hungry.

They said that strange creature is in the swampy water, big 
gooey and it hunts it's prey by covering it with the slimy
substance preventing the prey to move and then they slowly 
cover it and digest it. They barely escaped as it the 
creature cant get into the forest. 
They seen the creature to rapidly multiply! 
We have to investigate! The beas was last seen to the 
north of current position.
