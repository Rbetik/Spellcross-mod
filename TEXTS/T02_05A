We are at the foot of Theyssen mountains, The time has come 
for our attack! It seems that here lies the main enamy camp.
If we succed with conquering this staging area the enemy forces 
in hole region will be forced to retreat and let us take controll.
Maybe we shoud use some canning tactics, ork cam is devided to two
parts, lets attact the first one at night with quick hit and run
clean sweep to weaken enemy!!
