Message from the head of the science team:

Hello commander, 
I would like to inform you that our research base here
has been up and running. So far we hevn't gathered much 
information, but closer examination of weapons and 
artifacts found on the bodys of dead enemy orks and 
other beasts tells with no doubt that we're dealing 
with enemy much more developed than how it looks like.

They use axes and bow, classic armor like soldiers in 
medieval times and still they are even match for our 
soldiers equipped with rifles?                            



Best regards 
R. Huntik (almost) Ph.D.
