Hello commander,
What the hell was that creature?!
Anyway I have a good news and bad news.
Good news is that that territory is 
strategically useless. So maybe it would 
be best not to engage.
Bad news is that there are some natural gas 
and oil deposites on that swampy region. 
So it may be usefull to get it and make some
money for research!
The choice is yours to make.

James.
