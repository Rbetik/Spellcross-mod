This is it!! Our scauts have seen large army
from the gate teritory, that we expect to be 
the army waiting to ambush us at the gate, on 
the move towards our position. We should expect
strong attack soon. Get ready!
On the other hand, NOW, after Dragoth has sand 
the large portion of his army to chase us, is realy 
the time to attack Tarag-gur and the gate itself!!
