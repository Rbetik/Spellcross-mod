Him: Stop, who's ther, stop or I'll shoot.

Me: Im cpt. Alexander, im with Alliance. I heard 
    your distress call. I'm here to help.

Him: Ok sorry Im a little on edge.
    listne, Im here... well actually I was here on a secret
    mission. Im with the newly formed science divison of the
    alliance. I was send here to gether ... well it's secret.
    I cant tell you. I was protected by the elite units.
    We were ambushed and most of them are dead, but snipers 
    squad survived, and commandos squad survived.
    Last I had contact with them sniper squad alfa was hidding in 
    the forest 2 kliks to the west. 
    Commandos last reported they were captured by some trap to the east of 
    here in the forest.

Me: Ok let's get them.

Him: Ye that's a good idea. The mission for me is over, according to 
    reading on my measuring aparatus. The enemy I was tracking is long 
    gone. But if you help me get to the Outpost my commanding officer 
    will be very greatful.

Him: And one more thing, I heard on my wolkie-tolkie some more alliance units, 
    they are probably around. It would be worth to do some scouting around when 
    we gethered some men power.
