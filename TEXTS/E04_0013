This is massage from science team:

Commander We most gratefully thank you for saving us!
You can keep the TAM tank as well as the crew, it's the
least we can do in return!

We have some information for you. The strange powerful enemy 
stone units called golems are protected by some magical 
protecting shield, you shoud start researching it as soon 
as possible. We experimented with the shields and it seems
like laser weapons might be highly useful against it!!!
