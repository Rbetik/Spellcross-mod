The Helios reactor engine is based on the hydrogen 
fusion nuclear reaction. It was long envisioned as a
ideal power source, however only with the help of the
superconducting materials and advanced alloys found 
near magic wells this engine could be build so that
 it is small enough to fit into the armored vehicle.
