We managed to manufacture the cold fusion reactor. Its 
large version that would be suitable for vehicles is 
not comparable in output with Helios I reactor therefore
it was decided not to manufacture the large version.
The smaller version however, is ideal for armored infa-
ntry and could provide the extra power necessary for 
equiping the soldiers with more devastating EM weapons.
