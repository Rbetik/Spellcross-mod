Caseless amunition is a concept where brass or steel metal casing of standard 
rifle and submachine gun amunition cartrige is substitided with nitrocelulose 
casing. There are already many light weapons based on this technology (eg. H&K G11).
However, due to many technical problems like ammo fragility, low tolerance to 
gun barrel heating etc. military aplications were rather limited so far.
