Poor people who lost everything to the other side, 
to the point when they have no hope left, only the 
rage and they wont to kill as many of Other side units 
as they can. With no training, no military skills 
it's no surprise they wont to use this suicide bombing
tactics. The brutality of Other Side drove them to the 
border of madnes. Should we help them get their revange?
