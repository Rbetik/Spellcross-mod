Suicide squad is a scary but fitting name for this 
improvised army units. They consist of man (and women,
unfortunatelly) who volunteered as suiciders.
They lost everything to the OS and each one of them
wonts to kill some enemy even if it is last thing he does.

As sad as this is, desperate times calls for desperate measures.
These times could not be more desperate! 
Tactically this unit offers increadible advantage.
