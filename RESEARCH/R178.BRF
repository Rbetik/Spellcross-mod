Fighting against OS units proves to be much different
than what our military is trained and equipped for.
We dont know almost anything about the enemy. Orks and
wolfs seem to use axes and other meele weaons agains 
our soldiers with assault rifles and still they manage to 
fight on equall footing. How is that possible?

In any case, new type of warfare and new enemy forces us to 
look for new ways to improve the equipment of our troops.
