The EM-Storm represents unique piece of engineering.
It's desingn is based on Mi-24 with reinforced hull
with new carbon-nanofiber materials so that it 
can carry powerfull electromagnetic gun. 
Basic desing is rather mediocre in performance, 
however this machine was engineered to be able to 
be upgraded with helios power core as well as 
more advanced EM weapon systems.
With those this would become truly flying monster.
