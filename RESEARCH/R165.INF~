Soldiers fighting other side often reported that
bullets fired on enemy orks seem to evade the target
or even go right through as the target wasn't there.
This first seemed like a madman tolk. However our 
research of crystals found on dead orks proved that
it was not!. Crystals were rather small like a gems
carried on a necklace. We found few that were still 
active. They radiate strange blue light and forms 
what appears to be a shield around a person carrying
it. When we test fired on the crystal it slowed the
bullets aiming straight at it or diverted the bullets
passing farther away. Every succesive shot seemed to 
be slowed less than previous one. After couple of shots
crystal become depleted. We found couple of full 
crystals. When we shot at them the bullet seemed to 
pass right through like it was teleported through the
person.                                             
What is this?? Magic shields! Who made them?? 
Obviously the orks and elves are just using them and
have no means to charge them back of made a new one.
What is that energy? Where does it come from?    
All this is highly disturbing and we can only assume
that larger versions of this crystals would provide
more protection and would be depleted more slowely.
Classical weapons would be useless agains this. 
We found out that rate of depleting the crystal is 
proportional to the kinetic energy of bullet fired on 
it.                                                 
This means one thing ... we need to develope a weapons
that can fire projectiles at much higher velocities.
