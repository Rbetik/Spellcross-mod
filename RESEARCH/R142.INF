The new ATI (advanced thermal imaging) technology 
allows for construction of high-power sniper scope
based on thermal imaging. This is most crucial 
since other-side usually covers battlefield with fog. 

Thermovision is not affected by fog thus enganceing 
unit sight range. Automatic aiming system allows for 
better precision which results in higher range and damage.

This is naturally great upgrade for snipers, it's also
usefull for hummer (since their primary role is spotting)
