Ballistas arrows are made of plain wood shaft and 
feathers (just like in medieval times in europe);
however the arrowhead is made of crystalic material,
not very hard, brittle and extremaly explosive.    
The chemical composition is very simple, it's almost 
pure carbon. Detail study using modern analytical 
methods revealed that it is composed almost entirely 
from fullerenes. Those compounds are not crystaline 
in normal circumstances. What forces fullerenes to 
form crystals?? Nevertheless, what's even more intiguing
is the fact that the crystal explodes upon impact 
releasing approximatelly 10 times more energy than 
the same amount of one of the most powerful known 
military explosive - RDX. That energy can not come 
from any possible chemical reaction. The nuclear 
reactions are basicaly impossible under the 
circumstances, so where does it come from??. 
This investigation raises more questions than answears.
However using this material in small amounts might 
help increase explosive power of common granades and
other small caliber explosive charges. For bigger 
callibers it is too dangerous for now.
