The addition of powdered magnesium and aluminium to 
napalm is known way to increase the burning 
temperature; howeve addition of newly discovered highly 
energized material, so called archatria, to the napalm 
already enhanced with powdered metals mentioned above,
the enegry released during burning is immensly 
increashed reaching 3500 centigrades. Unfortunatelly, 
the napalm burns faster thus reducing the range of 
fire based weapons.
