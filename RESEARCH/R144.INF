Tactical reconfiguration for MLRS is a upgrade
which completly redesigns vehicles storage/engine 
area to be able to carry more missiles. It can 
only be accomplished with new materials which 
have a much higher stuctural integrity than 
best quality steels. Thus upgrade is expensive.
It offers better rate of fire, but smaller engine 
had to be used so MLRS will suffer from worse
mobility.
