The miniaturization of electromagnetic weapons in 
combination with modern infantry armors led to the 
Elmag troopers. Unit is equiped with powerful 
microfusion reactor providing it with surplus of 
electrical energy, which is is necessary for powering
elmag weapon. The weapon itself is a masterpeace of 
microtechnology. It has 2 types of firing mode. The 
first one fires bursts of small calliber projectiles 
with speeds exceeding 3 km/s, with devastating efects
to light and aereal units. Furthermore the bullets
heat up during the flight through the atmosphere so 
much that they bursts into flames upon impact. The 
second mod fires 15 mm projectile with 6 km/s speed.
The energy of the projectile in combination with 
precision of the rifle is devastating to heavy targets. 
This is truly the ultimate infantry.
