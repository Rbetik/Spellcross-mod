The Magneton armor is the best armor ever mage. The 
resiliance comes from combination of strength of
fulleride material (from which andurital armor is
made) and micro supraconducting coils which are build
within. The coils inside the fulleride armor works
similarly to steel rods in steel strenghtened concrete.
Strong magnetic field that binds coils together makes
them an order of magnitude stronger in tention than
strongest steel fibre.The armor is suitable only for
heaviest armored vehicles.
