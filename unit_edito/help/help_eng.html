&nbsp;&nbsp; This little program allows you to modify Spellcross units properties which are defined in 
binary file JENDOTKY.DEF in archive COMMON.FS. Spellcross game also allows you to add some extra units 
(only limited count but better than nothing).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; This program was created and tested in BDS2006 Turbo C++ at M$ Windows XP so I have no idea what 
it does in newer OS versions but since I didn't used anything XP specific it should work.
</p>

<br>
<div class="n2">1 - Settings</div><p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp; There is only one thing to set. You have to choose correct game version. Original CZ version 
has one byte shorter unit record so it's no compatible with any newer version. This setting is available in 
menu "Version". The same menu allows you to convert version from one to another (of course you will lost 
that one aditinal byte which contains "unit healed by fire" flag).
</p>

<table align="center"><tr><td>

</td></tr></table><br>

<div class="n2">2 - Editation</div><p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp; All items of program window have hint comments in both CZ and ENG language so
it should be obvious. 
Some items in unit record are a bit mysterious and are usually commented with "???". Not all 
values/combinations are valid. Game could crash (it should write reason into *.ERR file in game folder). 
I recommend you to make backup before editing. ;-)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Any changes in unit record has to be saved with button "Save changes". If you have 
changed something incorrectly you can "Discard chanes". You can also add new unit or remove last units from list. 
Only last unit can be removed because otherwise unit order would be changed and no other *.DEF file could work correctly. 
All the buttons down in the window affects only one selected unit. 
If you've finish editing you have to save whole unit list using menu "File". 
Changes in JEDNOTKY.DEF appears only in new game or new level (as almost every change in data archives). 
</p>

<div class="n3">2.1 - Editation, page Basic</div><p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are only the basic properties settings. There are some mysterious 
items but I think best way to hadnle them is to copy their values from similar units. 
It's mostly experimental work (edit/save/make common.fs/run game/fffuuuu because it's not doing what you thought it would). 
</p>

<div class="n3">2.2 - Editation, page Graphics</div><p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are defined unit graphics files. At first there is icon file and help resource and 
main unit graphics resources. 
Then there are attack animations for unit/weapon shot/projectile hit. There is also one field for 
projectile file which is common for all kinds of attack. 
</p>

<div class="n3">2.3 - Editation, page Sounds</div><p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sounds in Spellcross are defined using classes. Each unit has several class IDs for 
it's actions. Theese classes are defined in x_SOUNDS.DEF files in COMMON.FS (coresponding *.DEF files are 
in hint help). <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sounds are the biggest problem of Spellcross game because maximal count of 
classes pf each kind is limited. For example weapon sounds (A_SOUNDS.DEF) allows you to add only 2 additional classes for CZ version 
(ENG version seems to have bigger reserve). 
</p>

<table align="center"><tr><td>
<img src="obr/A_SOUNDS_DEF.png" alt="Sound classes *.DEF file example" title="Sound classes *.DEF file example">
</td></tr></table><br>

<div class="n3">2.4 - Editation, page Special actions</div><p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp; Allows you to set some special actions for units (for example aircraft take off or landing). 
Spellcross also allows you to make death action which is in newer game version used at least for 
death animation (not directly possible in CZ version). 
</p>

<div class="n3">2.5 - Editation, page Hex record viewer</div><p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp; It's result of debuging process. I've used it to understand meaning of more 
complex binary items. 
</p>

<div class="n3">2.6 - Editation, unit name</div><p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp; Actual unit name which is displayed is not defined in this JEDNOTKY.DEF file but 
in UNITS.ENG (or .CZ, .PL, etc.) text file in COMMON.FS where each unit has one line of text. 
Text encoding for CZ version is CP895, for PL version surprisingly CP1250, other languages probably uses CP1250 also.
